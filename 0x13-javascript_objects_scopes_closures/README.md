# JavaScript Objects, Scopes, and Closures

This repository contains a series of JavaScript tasks that focus on working with objects, scopes, and closures. Each task is implemented as a separate JavaScript file and demonstrates various concepts and techniques.

## Getting Started

To run and test the code for each task, follow the instructions below.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nicholas2023/alx-higher_level_programming
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. Navigate to the specific task directory:

   ```bash
   cd 0x13-javascript_objects_scopes_closures
   ```

3. Run the task's main JavaScript file:

   ```bash
   node task-main.js
   ```

   Replace `task-main.js` with the appropriate filename for the task you want to test.

## Tasks Overview

### Task 0: Rectangle #0

- Create an empty class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle.
- Output:
  ```
  Rectangle {}
  [Class: Rectangle]
  ```

### Task 1: Rectangle #1

- Define a class `Rectangle` that takes two arguments `w` and `h` in its constructor.
- Initialize the instance attributes `width` and `height` with the values of `w` and `h`.
- Output:
  ```
  Rectangle { width: 2, height: 3 }
  2
  3
  ```

### Task 2: Rectangle #2

- Extend the `Rectangle` class to handle cases where `w` or `h` is equal to 0 or not a positive integer.
- Output:
  ```
  Rectangle { width: 2, height: 3 }
  2
  3
  Rectangle {}
  undefined
  undefined
  ```
