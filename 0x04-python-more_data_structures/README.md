## Description

This repository contains Pyhton programs and functions that demonstrate the use of set and dictionary data structures. The programs are written as solutions to a series of tasks related to sets and dictionaries.

The tasks include:

1. Computing the square value of all integers in a matrix.
2. Replacing occurrences of an element in a list.
3. Adding all unique integers in a list.
4. Finding common elements between two sets.
5. Finding elements present in only one sets.
6. Counting the number of keys in a dictionary.
7. Printing a dictionary by ordered keys.
8. Updating a dictionary by adding or replacing key/value pairs.
9. Deleting a key in a dictionary.
10. Multiplying all values in a dictionary by 2.
11. Finding the key with the biggest integer value in a dictionary.
12. Converting a Roman numeral to an integer.

## Usage

To test the function, you can run the individual files or import the functions into your Python scripts and use them as needed.

Example:

```
from 0-square_matrix_simple imort square_matrix_simple

matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]

new_matrix = square_matrix_simple(matrix)
print(new_matrix)
```
