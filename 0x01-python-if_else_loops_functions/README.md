# 0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions

## Description

This directory contains programs written in Python for the purpose of learning about control structures such as `if/else` statements, loops (`while` and `for`), and functions.


## Files

The following files are contained in this directory:

### 0-positive_or_negative.py

This program assigns a random signed number to the variable `number` each time it is executed. The program prints whether the number stored in the variable `number` is positive, negative or zero.

### 1-last_digit.py

This program assigns a random signed number to the variable `number` each time it is executed. The program prints the last digit of the number stored in the variable `number` along with a message depending on the value of the last digit.

### 2-print_alphabet.py

This program prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line


## Usage

To run any of the programs, navigate to the directory containing the program in your terminal and run the command`./program_name.py`.

## Credits

All programs contained in this directory were by me, `Nicholas Otieno`, and are for the purpose of learning about control structures in Python.
