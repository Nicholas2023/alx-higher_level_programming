# 0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

## Description

This project contains several scripts written in Python for practice purposes. The focus of this project is on the manipulation of lists and tuples, two of the data structures in Python.


## Files

The following files were created as solutions to problems assigned:


### 0-print_list_integer.py

Function that prints all integers of a list, one integer per line.


### 1-element_at.py

Function that retrives an element from a list like in C. If the index is negative or out of range (> of number of elements in my_list), the function should return `None`.


### 2-replace_in_list.py

Function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position (like in C). If the index is negative or out of range (> of number of eements in my_list), the function should not modify anything and return the original list.


### 3-print_reversed_list_integer.py

Function that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order, one integer per line.


### 4-new_in_list.py

Function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list. If the index is negative or out of range, the function should return a copy of the original list.


## Usage

Each script is executable, and can be run on the command line with arguments. They can also be imported and used as a module in another Python script.
