# ALX Higher Level Programming

This repository contains the tasks and projects that I have completed as part of my coursework in Higher-level programming languages.

## Languages
The programming laguage that I have completed assignments in include:
* Python

## Table of Contents
This repository is organized into folders for each individual task. The main content of each assignment folder include:
* `README.md`: A brief description of the tasks and instructions for running the code
* `src`: Source code for the tasks
* `test/`: Test cases and test scripts for the tasks

## Running the Code
Each assignment folder contains a `REAME.md` file with instructions on how to run the code. Generally, the steps involve:

1. Install any necessary dependencies or libraries
2. Navigate to the `src/` directory
3. Run the main program file with the appropriate command (e.g. `python main.py`)

## Contributing
As these tasks are completedas part of my coursework, i am not accepting contributions to this repository at this time. However, if you notice any errors or have suggestions for improving the code, feel free to open an issue and I will do my best to address it.
